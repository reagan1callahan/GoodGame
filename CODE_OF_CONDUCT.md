Enforcement Responsibilities
The repository owner is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The repository owner has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all of the project spaces including the Github repository and the Gitbook space, and also applies when an individual is officially representing this project in public spaces.
